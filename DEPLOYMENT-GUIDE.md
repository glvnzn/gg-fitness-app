- [ ] **Node.js** installed (v16 or later)
- [ ] **Git** for transferring the project

### Optional (for device installation):
- [ ] **Apple Developer Account** ($99/year) - only needed for installing on physical iPhone

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Transfer Project to Mac
```bash
# Option A: If using Git
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd gg-fitness-app

# Option B: Transfer files directly
# Copy the entire gg-fitness-app folder to your Mac
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd gg-fitness-app

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Install Expo CLI globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup
```bash
# Check if everything is properly configured
npx expo doctor

# This will show any issues with your setup
```

### Step 4: Build for iOS

#### Option A: iOS Simulator (FREE - No Apple Developer Account Needed)
```bash
# This will open iOS Simulator and install the app
npx expo run:ios

# If you want to specify a specific simulator
npx expo run:ios --simulator "iPhone 15 Pro"
```

#### Option B: Physical iPhone (Requires Apple Developer Account)
```bash
# Make sure your iPhone is connected via USB
# and you've enabled Developer Mode in Settings

npx expo run:ios --device

# Select your iPhone when prompted
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Command not found: expo"
```bash
# Solution: Install Expo CLI globally
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
```

### Issue 2: Xcode Command Line Tools Missing
```bash

xcode-select --install
```

### Issue 3: "No development team found"
1. Open Xcode
2. Go to Preferences ‚Üí Accounts
3. Add your Apple ID
4. Select your development team in the project settings

## üì± Alternative Deployment Methods

### Method 1: EAS Build (Recommended for App Store)
```bash
# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure EAS (first time only)
eas build:configure

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios

# This creates an IPA file you can install via TestFlight
```

### Method 2: Development Build for Testing
```bash
# Creates a development build you can share
eas build --platform ios --profile development

# Good for testing on multiple devices
```

## üîÑ Updating the App

When you make changes to the code:

```bash
# For simulator
npx expo run:ios
